"""Answer evaluation contracts (Phase 8): the only shape a model may return, and the API views.

The model output carries evaluation content only. There is no field for an overall score, a
technical-correctness score, a recommended follow-up, an action, a status or a finish reason
(plan C-E1..C-E4), and unknown fields are rejected.
