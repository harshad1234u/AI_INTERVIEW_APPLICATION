"""Usage limits: the abuse and cost controls. Deterministic code; no model is ever involved.

Each limit counts requests per key in fixed windows aligned to the Unix epoch, in UTC: an hour
starts on the hour, a day at 00:00 UTC. One statement both checks and counts:

    INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET count = count + 1 WHERE count < max RETURNING count

so a limit holds under any number of concurrent requests, across processes, and survives restarts.
A request over the limit is refused and not counted. Model-backed work is charged when it is
admitted, whatever the provider then does, because the cost is incurred either way; a session's
deletion never gives anything back.
