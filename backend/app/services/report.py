"""Interview report (Phase 9, docs/phase-9-report-plan.md): a deterministic view of stored rows.

Nothing is stored and no model is called (R7, R9). The report is rebuilt from the session's plan
snapshot, questions, answers and evaluations on every read, so the same rows always give the same
report. Scores are shown one criterion of one answer at a time and never combined (R2). Every
sentence is fixed text chosen by code (plan §6); stored text (questions, quotes, concepts,
feedback) is only placed into fields, never interpreted.

Transaction contract (as elsewhere): complete_report() locks the session row, checks, builds and
applies REPORT_READY, all in the caller's transaction. The caller commits.
